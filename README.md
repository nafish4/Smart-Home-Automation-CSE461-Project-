# Smart-Home-Automation-CSE461-Project-

Our project focuses on delivering an efficient security and fire protection system for users' homes, divided into two key components. The security system safeguards the interior by detecting intruders through strategically placed sensors. For instance, a force sensor installed on the floor activates alarms, such as a buzzer and LEDs, upon detecting unauthorized entry. The system also sends an alert to the user's phone via Bluetooth. If the user identifies the alarm as false, they can deactivate it remotely, although the sensors remain active and will re-alert if necessary. A physical kill switch allows the user to permanently deactivate or reactivate the system. To enhance security, PIR sensors detect motion through changes in infrared radiation, triggering alarms and notifying the user in a similar manner.

The fire alarm system incorporates flame sensors and a DHT22 sensor to monitor fire risks. The flame sensor identifies fire presence, while the DHT22 measures temperature continuously. If the temperature exceeds a set threshold, a motor activates to sprinkle water, with the sprinkling intensity increasing as the temperature rises. Simultaneously, a buzzer and LEDs are triggered to signal the fire, and a notification is sent to the user's mobile device, ensuring prompt awareness and response.
